						<p>“Kike is a force of nature.  I worked with her after launching my company Chew Street.  I was happy with my full time job but needed help on how to balance my passion project, make it profitable, and ensure that the company could contribute to causes that are important to me.  Kike has boundless energy and a natural talent for transforming creative ideas into action plans that are easy to implement. She really cares about the women she works with and the projects she takes on.”</p>
